# BE-dataHIVE 
BE-dataHIVE is a mySQL base editing database for practicioners and computer scientist. The database can be access via our website [be-datahive.com](https://be-datahive.com/) or our [API](https://be-datahive.com/documentation.html)

## Code Structure
    run_processing.py             - runs all data processing functions
    initial_data_processing.py    - contains all functions for the initial data processing of study data
    data_enrichment.py            - contains all functions used to enrich base editing data
